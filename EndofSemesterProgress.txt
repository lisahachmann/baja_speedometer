Baja: State as of the end of the Fall semester 2016. 
LHachmann

-had picked AH9250 as the hall effect sensor
-had bought 10 magnets of ~3 lb. pull force to attach onto axle
	-had determined that 1 magnet's range to hall effect sensor was ~1 cm. 
	-determined that stronger magnets could be bought (but capped as to not disturb the half shaft) or magnets could be put into stronger order. 
-3 arduino nanos had been bought
-code for hall effect sensing (in RPM)--> bluetooth sending had been written 
	-tested in parts: sending has been tested and verified, hall effect sensing has been tested and verified
	-overall however is untested
		-concept is that if we're reading 0000001100000011 where 1 means that the magnet is near, then we measure the time between getting 1's
-code for (general) bluetooth receiving had been written
-LCD screen worked with the pins 7-12
	-D4 to pin 9
	-D5 to pin 10
	-D6 to pin 11
	-D7 to pin 12
	-RS to pin 7
	-E to pin 8
-thermal sensor had been picked out and bought
	-no code had been written due to uncertainty over correct microprocessor/communication handling (I2C)
-(bad) solderboards had been started for the bluetooth chips
